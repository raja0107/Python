Complier Vs Interpreter?

A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file.
The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking.
Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++.

An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code.
Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab.
